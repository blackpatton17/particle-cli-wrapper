# Next Gen Particle CLI

*This is an experimental tool.*

# [Installer website](https://www.particle.io/cli)

## Overview

**The Next Gen Particle CLI is a delicacy consisting of a light Go shell filled with a sweet creamy Node.js core.**

The Go shell manages its own Node.js installation. It is able to update itself and the Node plugins. It forwards commands to the Node.js core. Since it is compiled natively for each platform it is easy to install.

The Node.js core is today's production Particle CLI. It performs all interactions with the Particle cloud.
